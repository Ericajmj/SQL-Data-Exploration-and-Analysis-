# SQL Data Exploration and Analysis (Using PostgreSQL for queries)

 ## Project Objective

In this project, I used joins and filtering to analyze relational data across multiple tables. I applied aggregate functions and subqueries for calculating metrics like average salary and identifying top employees, while utilizing GROUP BY and HAVING for grouping and refining results.

## Skills used

Joins, Filtering Data, Aggregate Functions, Subqueries, Grouping Data, and HAVING Clause.
